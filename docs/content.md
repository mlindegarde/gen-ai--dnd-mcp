## Arcane Tradition: School of Abjuration (Chosen at Level 2)

### Abjuration Savant
- The gold and time you must spend to copy an abjuration spell into your spellbook is halved.

### Arcane Ward
- When you cast an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you create an Arcane Ward:
  - Ward HP: 2 × your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier = **16 HP** (2 × 6 + 4 [Int 18] = 16).
  - The ward absorbs damage that would reduce your HP, recharging when you cast other abjuration spells.

### Projected Ward (NEW at Level 6)
- When a creature within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that damage. The ward transfers as much of the damage as possible to itself.

## Character Development

Over the course of our campaign, Erilon’s actions and demeanor have been shaped by a lingering sense of guilt and caution. The haunting memory of a costly battlefield mistake drives many of Erilon’s choices: he hesitates to unleash powerful area-of-effect spells, fearing collateral damage and harm to allies. This caution often leads Erilon to seek safer, more controlled approaches in combat, and he’s quick to support his companions defensively—preferring spells like Shield or Counterspell over reckless offense.

Erilon’s inclination to help NPCs is rooted in both empathy and a desire for redemption. Whenever possible, he intervenes on behalf of those in need, whether patching wounds, offering advice, or sharing resources. This generous spirit reflects his bond ("I would still lay down my life for the people I served with") and ideal ("Might. In life as in war, the stronger force wins")—he’s always striving to protect and strengthen those around him, even if it means exposing himself to risk.

While Erilon’s military background is a source of wisdom and cautionary tales, he rarely volunteers these stories unprompted. When he does, it’s often in moments of crisis or reflection, trying to guide the party away from repeating his own past mistakes.

Despite good intentions, Erilon’s attempts at leadership have sometimes backfired. Notable moments—like poking at a giant plant that then attacked the party—serve as reminders of the consequences of hasty action. These experiences reinforce his hesitance and his ongoing struggle to balance initiative with caution.

Overall, Erilon is a character driven by remorse and the hope for redemption. His journey is marked by a careful approach to magic, a willingness to help, and a deep loyalty to his companions—yet always shadowed by the fear of repeating past errors.

## Tactics & Spell Combos

### Arcane Ward Management
- **Keep Your Ward Up:** Start each day by casting Mage Armor (Abjuration) to create or refresh your Arcane Ward (max 16 HP at level 6). Use other abjuration spells during combat (Shield, Alarm, Counterspell, Banishment) to restore ward HP (2 × spell level per cast).
- **Projected Ward Reaction:** When an ally within 30 ft is hit, use your reaction to absorb damage with your Arcane Ward, then refresh the ward with an abjuration spell on your turn.

### Defensive Layering
- **Stack Defenses:** Wear Mithral Chain Mail and Cloak of Protection. Cast Mage Armor for the Arcane Ward. Use Shield as a reaction for emergency AC and extra Arcane Ward HP.
- **Counterspell:** Use to negate enemy spells while also refreshing your ward.

### Offensive Combos
- **Ray of Frost + Fireball:** Slow a fast-moving foe with Ray of Frost, then target clustered enemies with Fireball or Necklace of Fireballs for high AoE damage.
- **Dragon’s Breath on Familiar/Ally:** Cast Dragon’s Breath on a familiar or ally for bonus action AoE damage each round, letting you still cast spells or cantrips yourself.
- **Fireball + Necklace of Fireballs:** Overwhelm a group in one round by casting Fireball and throwing fireball beads (if not using your action for something else).

### Control & Battlefield Manipulation
- **Banishment + Party Focus:** Remove a major enemy like a dragon with Banishment, letting your party heal, reposition, or defeat minions. Prepare the battlefield for when the banished foe returns.
- **Leomund’s Tiny Hut:** Use after Banishment to take a safe rest or to fortify a position.
- **Alarm:** Cast Alarm before rests to avoid being ambushed and refresh your Arcane Ward at no combat cost.

### Utility and Mobility
- **Misty Step:** Use to escape grapples, get out of melee, or reposition for better spell targeting.
- **Hat of Wizardry:** If a needed cantrip isn’t prepared, use the hat’s ability for situational flexibility.

#### Useful Cantrips with Hat of Wizardry
- **Toll the Dead:** 2d12 necrotic damage to a wounded creature (Wis save). Excellent for finishing weakened foes like a dragon, especially those with low Wisdom.
- **Shocking Grasp:** 2d8 lightning damage (melee spell attack); prevents target from taking reactions until its next turn. Good for escaping melee or preventing opportunity attacks.
- **Chill Touch:** 2d8 necrotic damage (ranged spell attack); target can't regain hit points until your next turn. Useful if facing regeneration or healing.
- **Sword Burst:** 2d6 force damage (Dex save) to all creatures within 5 feet. Effective if you are surrounded by multiple enemies.

| Cantrip         | Damage (at 6th) | Save/Attack | Notes                                         |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Toll the Dead   | 2d12 necrotic   | Wis save    | Best raw damage vs. wounded targets           |
| Shocking Grasp  | 2d8 lightning   | Melee atk   | Prevents reactions, good for retreat/escape   |
| Chill Touch     | 2d8 necrotic    | Ranged atk  | Blocks healing, solid damage                  |
| Sword Burst     | 2d6 force       | Dex save    | Good if surrounded, force is rarely resisted  |

### Reaction Optimization
- **Shield or Counterspell:** Always keep a slot ready for these; they can save your life or an ally’s with a single reaction and refresh your Arcane Ward.

### Example Turn: Dragon Showdown
1. **Pre-battle:** Cast Mage Armor for AC and Arcane Ward.
2. **Round 1:** Cast Banishment to try to remove the dragon (Charisma save); if successful, heal or prep with your party for one minute.
3. **If Banishment fails:** Use Fireball or, if your Hat of Wizardry is available, attempt Toll the Dead for high necrotic damage.
4. **When attacked:** Use Shield for defense and to refresh Arcane Ward.
5. **When an ally is targeted:** Use Projected Ward as a reaction to protect them.
6. **If needing to escape melee:** Use Misty Step or, via the Hat, Shocking Grasp to avoid opportunity attacks.

---

**Tip:**  
- Use abjuration spells both for their effects and to keep your Arcane Ward strong.
- Use Hat of Wizardry to access cantrips that exploit enemy weaknesses or fit tactical needs in the moment.
- Combine control (Banishment), damage (Fireball, cantrips), and defense (Shield, Arcane Ward) for maximum flexibility and impact.
