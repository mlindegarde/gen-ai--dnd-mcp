# Feature Specification: Add Spell Slot Tracking

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-spell-slot`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add spell slot tracking"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Display Available Spell Slots (Priority: P1)

D&D players need to see their current spell slots by level on their character sheet to know what spells they can cast during gameplay.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables basic spell slot management - without this, players cannot track their most fundamental spellcasting resource.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a character sheet with spell slots and verifying all slot levels and quantities are correctly displayed, delivering immediate value for spell slot awareness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a single-class spellcaster character with spell slots, **When** viewing their character sheet, **Then** all spell slot levels (1st through 9th) are displayed with current available counts
2. **Given** a non-spellcaster character, **When** viewing their character sheet, **Then** no spell slot section appears
3. **Given** a third-caster character (Eldritch Knight/Arcane Trickster), **When** viewing their character sheet, **Then** spell slots are calculated using third-caster progression

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a character has no spell slots (non-casters)?
- How does system handle third-caster subclasses (Eldritch Knight/Arcane Trickster)?
- What happens when character level changes and spell slot maximums change?
- How does system handle temporary spell slot bonuses or penalties?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST calculate maximum spell slots based on character class and level according to D&D 5e rules
- **FR-002**: System MUST display current available spell slots for each spell level (1st through 9th)
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle single-class spellcaster slot calculations according to D&D 5e rules
- **FR-007**: System MUST hide spell slot tracking for non-spellcasting characters
- **FR-009**: System MUST update spell slot maximums when character level or class changes

### Key Entities

- **Spell Slot**: Represents a magical resource with level (1-9), maximum count, and current available count
- **Character Class**: Determines spell slot progression and spellcasting ability
- **Character Level**: Influences total spell slots available for each class

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Players can identify available spell slots for any level in under 5 seconds
- **SC-003**: System accurately calculates spell slots for all official D&D 5e single-class characters

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

- Characters follow standard D&D 5e spellcasting rules and progressions
- Players understand basic D&D 5e spell slot mechanics
- Character data includes class and level information required for spell slot calculations
- System already handles character class and level data accurately

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

- Existing character class and level data structure
- D&D 5e spell slot progression tables and multiclassing rules
- Character data persistence system
- PDF form field mapping for spell slot display

## Scope *(mandatory)*

### In Scope
- Spell slot tracking for all official D&D 5e single-class characters
- Integration with existing character sheet PDF

### Out of Scope
- Multiclass spellcaster slot calculations (future enhancement)
- Spell slot usage tracking
- Short rest spell slot recovery mechanics
- Warlock pact magic slots (treated as regular spell slots)
- Custom or homebrew spellcasting classes
- Spell preparation tracking
- Individual spell usage history
- Automatic spell slot consumption when spells are cast
- Basic usage and reset functionality
