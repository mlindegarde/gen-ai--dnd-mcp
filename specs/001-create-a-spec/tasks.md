# Tasks: MCP Server with PDF Form Filling Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-create-a-spec/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the specification, so test tasks are omitted.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths assume single Rust project structure per plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 ‚úÖ Create Rust project structure with Cargo.toml and src/ directory
- [x] T002 ‚úÖ Add dependencies to Cargo.toml: lopdf, pdf-writer, serde_json, tokio
- [x] T003 ‚úÖ [P] Create docs/ directory and place D&D 5e character sheet PDF at docs/5E_CharacterSheet_Fillable.pdf
- [x] T004 ‚úÖ [P] Create tests/ directory structure with integration/ and unit/ subdirectories
- [x] T005 ‚úÖ [P] Create tests/fixtures/ directory for sample character data and PDFs
- [x] T006 ‚úÖ [P] Configure Rust formatting and linting in Cargo.toml

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T007 ‚úÖ COMPLETE - PDF field analysis exists at docs/pdf-field-analysis.md
- [x] T008 ‚úÖ COMPLETE - D&D rules documented at docs/dnd-rules.md  
- [x] T009 ‚úÖ COMPLETE - MCP protocol examples at docs/mcp-protocol-examples.md
- [x] T009b ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Sample test data created at docs/sample-data.md
- [x] T010 ‚úÖ Create character_model.rs with core D&D 5e data structures (Character, AbilityScores, Skills, Combat, Spells, Proficiencies, Equipment, CharacterNarrative)
- [x] T011 ‚úÖ Implement D&D 5e validation rules in dnd_validator.rs (reference docs/dnd-rules.md for exact formulas)
- [x] T012 ‚úÖ Create field_mapper.rs with hardcoded mapping from D&D terms to PDF field names (reference docs/pdf-field-analysis.md)
- [x] T013 ‚úÖ [P] Implement comprehensive error types and messages in src/errors.rs (reference docs/dnd-rules.md for error messages)
- [x] T014 ‚úÖ [P] Create spell_system.rs for spell organization by level (cantrips through 9th level)
- [x] T015 ‚úÖ [P] Create narrative_handler.rs for character personality and backstory fields
- [x] T016 ‚úÖ Create validation rule test cases in tests/fixtures/validation-test-cases.json

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

**üìã Gap Analysis Status**: All critical specification gaps have been addressed:
- ‚úÖ PDF field mappings documented with exact field names
- ‚úÖ D&D rule formulas specified with precise calculations  
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol examples with concrete JSON-RPC messages
- ‚úÖ Sample test data covering edge cases and validation scenarios

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic PDF Form Population (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Core PDF filling functionality that accepts D&D character data and generates filled character sheet

**Independent Test**: Provide sample D&D character JSON data and verify output PDF contains correct values in correct fields

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - MCP Server Integration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: MCP protocol server that exposes PDF filling tool to AI assistants and other MCP clients

**Independent Test**: Connect MCP client to server and successfully invoke PDF filling tool through protocol

### Implementation for User Story 2

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Extends US1 functionality but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models and core logic before integration
- Core implementation before MCP integration
- Basic functionality before enhanced features
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models and independent modules within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch independent modules for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Implement PDF parsing and field discovery in pdf_filler.rs"
Task: "Add ability score modifier calculations to character_model.rs"

# After core modules are ready, integrate:
Task: "Implement basic PDF form filling logic in pdf_filler.rs"
Task: "Add D&D rule validation integration in pdf_filler.rs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with sample D&D character data
5. Deploy/demo basic PDF filling functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MCP integration)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Enhanced validation)
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Core PDF filling)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (MCP server integration)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Field discovery and validation)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Focus on D&D 5e character sheet as the primary use case
- Spell system includes cantrips (level 0) through 9th level spells
- Character narrative includes personality traits, backstory, and appearance
- Proficiency indicators use filled circles in PDF form
- MCP protocol follows JSON-RPC 2.0 specification
- All PDF processing runs locally without external dependencies
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
