# Feature Specification: MCP Server with PDF Form Filling Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-spec`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a spec that I can use to implement the basic MCP server along with the first tool.  The first tool will be used to populate a fillable PDF based on provided input."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic PDF Form Population (Priority: P1)

A user has a fillable PDF form and structured data that needs to be inserted into specific form fields. They want to automate this process rather than manually filling out forms.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value - automating repetitive form filling tasks saves significant time and reduces errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing a sample PDF form with text fields and a data payload, then verifying the output PDF contains the correct values in the correct fields.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fillable PDF with text fields and a data mapping, **When** the tool is invoked with field values, **Then** a new PDF is generated with all specified fields populated correctly
2. **Given** a PDF form with various field types (text, checkbox, dropdown), **When** appropriate data is provided for each field type, **Then** all fields are populated according to their type constraints
3. **Given** invalid or missing data for required fields, **When** the tool is invoked, **Then** clear error messages indicate which fields failed and why

### User Story 2 - MCP Server Integration (Priority: P2)

A client application needs to communicate with the PDF filling functionality through the Model Context Protocol, enabling integration with AI assistants and other MCP-compatible tools.

**Why this priority**: MCP integration enables the tool to be used by AI assistants and other applications, significantly expanding its utility and accessibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting an MCP client to the server and successfully invoking the PDF filling tool through the protocol.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an MCP server is running, **When** a client connects and requests available tools, **Then** the PDF filling tool is listed with proper schema documentation
2. **Given** a connected MCP client, **When** the PDF filling tool is invoked with valid parameters, **Then** the operation completes successfully and returns the filled PDF
3. **Given** an MCP client connection, **When** invalid parameters are sent, **Then** appropriate error responses are returned following MCP protocol standards

### User Story 3 - Field Mapping and Validation (Priority: P3)

Users need to understand what fields are available in a PDF form and ensure their data matches the expected format and constraints for each field.

**Why this priority**: This enhances usability by helping users understand form structure and preventing common data format errors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by analyzing a PDF form and returning a complete list of fillable fields with their properties and constraints.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a PDF form, **When** field discovery is requested, **Then** all fillable fields are identified with their names, types, and constraints
2. **Given** data that doesn't match field constraints, **When** validation is performed, **Then** specific validation errors are returned for each problematic field
3. **Given** a complex form with nested fields or groups, **When** field mapping is requested, **Then** the hierarchical structure is clearly represented

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a PDF is password-protected or encrypted?
- How does the system handle PDFs with complex layouts or non-standard field implementations?
- What occurs when the output PDF would exceed file size limits?
- How are special characters and Unicode text handled in form fields?
- What happens when a PDF form has read-only or calculated fields?
- What happens when character data violates D&D 5e rules but user wants to proceed anyway?
- What happens when a character has more spells than available slots in the PDF for a given level or cantrip section?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

- **FR-014**: System MUST support spell data including spell name, base level (0-9), and prepared state, organizing cantrips (level 0) and leveled spells (1-9) in their appropriate PDF page sections
- **FR-015**: System MUST calculate spell attack bonus and spell save DC from provided spellcasting ability modifier and proficiency bonus when not explicitly provided
- **FR-016**: System MUST support proficiency lists (weapons, armor, languages, tools) and mark proficiency indicators (circles) for skills and saving throws on the PDF
- **FR-017**: System MUST support character narrative fields including Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, Character Appearance, Additional Features & Traits, Treasure, and Character Backstory
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide detailed PDF field mapping documentation including exact PDF field names for all D&D character sheet elements
