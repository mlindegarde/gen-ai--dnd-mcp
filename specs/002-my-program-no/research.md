# Research: PDF File Saving Fix

**Date**: 2025-10-14  
**Feature**: PDF File Saving Fix  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Analysis

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. PDF Writing Pipeline Analysis

**Decision**: Use existing lopdf crate for PDF manipulation with enhanced error handling  
**Rationale**: lopdf is already integrated and provides robust PDF form filling capabilities. The issue is likely in error handling or file I/O operations rather than the core PDF library.  
**Alternatives considered**: 
- pdf-writer crate: More low-level, would require significant refactoring
- External PDF tools: Violates Local-First principle
- Different Rust PDF libraries: lopdf is mature and well-maintained

### 2. File I/O Error Handling Best Practices

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error chain with specific error types for each failure mode  
**Rationale**: Current error handling may be too generic, making it difficult to diagnose PDF saving failures. Rust's Result type system allows for detailed error categorization.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic error messages: Insufficient for user troubleshooting
- Panic on errors: Poor user experience
- Silent failures: Unacceptable for file operations

### 3. File System Validation Patterns

**Decision**: Pre-validate paths, permissions, and disk space before attempting PDF write operations  
**Rationale**: Proactive validation prevents partial writes and provides better error messages to users.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- Write-then-validate: Risk of partial files and poor error recovery
- No validation: Current approach that's causing issues
- OS-specific validation: Adds complexity without significant benefit

### 4. PDF Integrity Verification

**Decision**: Implement post-write PDF validation by attempting to re-open and verify structure  
**Rationale**: Ensures saved files are not corrupted and can be opened by PDF readers. Provides confidence in the save operation.  
**Alternatives considered**:
- No verification: Risk of corrupted output files
- Checksum validation: Doesn't verify PDF structure validity
- Full content comparison: Overly complex for this use case

## Technical Decisions Summary

1. **Error Handling Strategy**: Implement detailed error types for path validation, permission checks, disk space, and PDF writing operations
2. **Validation Approach**: Pre-flight checks for file system operations followed by post-write integrity verification
3. **User Feedback**: Provide specific, actionable error messages for each failure scenario
4. **File Management**: Auto-create parent directories and handle overwrite scenarios gracefully

## Implementation Approach

The fix will focus on the `pdf_filler.rs` module with enhancements to:
- Path validation and sanitization
- Directory creation logic
- Error type definitions and handling
- PDF integrity verification
- User-friendly error messaging

No changes needed to the core PDF manipulation logic or MCP protocol interface.
