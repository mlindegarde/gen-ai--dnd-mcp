# Feature Specification: PDF File Saving Fix

**Feature Branch**: `002-my-program-no`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "My program no longer correctly saves the filled in PDF file and I need to figure how to fix it."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Successful PDF File Output (Priority: P1)

A user fills out D&D character data and expects the program to save a completed PDF file to the specified location with all form fields properly populated.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without reliable PDF saving, the entire program fails to deliver its primary value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the character sheet filler with valid character data and verifying a properly formatted PDF file is created at the expected location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid character data and default output path, **When** user runs the fill operation, **Then** a PDF file is created at "filled_character_sheet.pdf" with all character data populated
2. **Given** valid character data and custom output path, **When** user specifies a custom file path, **Then** a PDF file is created at the specified location
3. **Given** character data with all spell levels, **When** user runs the fill operation, **Then** the saved PDF contains all spells organized by level with proper formatting

### User Story 2 - Error Handling and Diagnostics (Priority: P2)

When PDF saving fails, users receive clear error messages that help them understand what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.

**Why this priority**: Users need actionable feedback when the save operation fails to troubleshoot and resolve issues independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating various failure conditions (invalid paths, permission issues, corrupted templates) and verifying appropriate error messages are displayed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invalid output path, **When** user attempts to save, **Then** system displays clear error message indicating path issue and suggests valid alternatives
2. **Given** insufficient file permissions, **When** user attempts to save, **Then** system displays permission error with guidance on how to resolve
3. **Given** a corrupted PDF template, **When** user attempts to fill the form, **Then** system detects template issues and provides diagnostic information

---

### User Story 3 - File Overwrite Protection (Priority: P3)

Users are protected from accidentally overwriting existing PDF files and can choose how to handle file conflicts.

**Why this priority**: Prevents data loss and gives users control over file management, though not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating existing files at target locations and verifying the system's conflict resolution behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing file at the target location, **When** user attempts to save, **Then** system automatically overwrites the existing file
2. **Given** multiple save operations to the same path, **When** user runs consecutive fills, **Then** system handles file conflicts consistently

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the output directory doesn't exist?
- How does system handle extremely long file paths?
- What occurs when disk space is insufficient for the PDF file?
- How does the system behave with special characters in file paths?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST successfully write filled PDF files to the filesystem at the specified output location
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve all character data formatting and layout when saving PDF files
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate output file paths before attempting to write files
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear error messages when PDF saving operations fail
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle file permission issues gracefully with actionable error messages
- **FR-006**: System MUST create parent directories if they don't exist when saving to nested paths
- **FR-007**: System MUST verify PDF file integrity after saving to ensure data wasn't corrupted during write operations

### Key Entities

- **PDF Output File**: The final filled character sheet PDF containing all user data, saved to filesystem
- **Output Path**: File system location where the PDF should be saved, including filename and extension
- **Character Data**: The D&D character information that gets populated into the PDF form fields

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of valid character data inputs result in successfully saved PDF files when using default output paths
- **SC-002**: PDF files are saved within 2 seconds for character sheets under typical data volumes (standard character with spells)
- **SC-003**: System provides diagnostic error messages for 100% of save operation failures within 1 second of detection
- **SC-004**: Users can successfully save PDF files to custom paths in 95% of attempts when paths are valid and accessible

## Assumptions

- Users have appropriate file system permissions for their chosen output locations
- The PDF template file is accessible and not corrupted
- Output file paths follow standard operating system conventions
- Users expect immediate feedback when save operations complete or fail
