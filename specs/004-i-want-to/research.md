# Research: Character Sheet PDF Population

**Feature**: Character Sheet PDF Population (Saves, Skills, Spells)  
**Generated**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: No research required - all technical details known

## Research Summary

No formal research phase was required for this feature as all technical context was already established:

- **Language/Framework**: Rust 1.75+ with lopdf and serde_json (existing dependencies)
- **PDF Field Mappings**: Systematically verified through testing (documented in CHECKBOX_MAPPING_PROGRESS.md)
- **D&D 5e Rules**: Well-established calculations already implemented in codebase
- **Performance Requirements**: Aligned with existing constitution (<2 seconds, <100MB memory)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision: Extend Existing Modules
**Rationale**: Follows Simplicity First principle by building on established codebase rather than creating new abstractions.
**Alternatives considered**: Creating separate modules for saves/skills/spells, but rejected due to unnecessary complexity.

### Decision: Use Verified Checkbox Mappings  
**Rationale**: Systematic testing completed to map all checkbox fields for saving throws, skills, and spell preparation.
**Alternatives considered**: Dynamic field discovery, but rejected in favor of reliable hardcoded mappings.

### Decision: Graceful Error Handling
**Rationale**: Allows partial success when some character data is invalid, improving user experience.
**Alternatives considered**: Fail-fast approach, but rejected to maintain usability with incomplete data.

## Implementation Approach

The feature extends existing modules:
- `field_mapper.rs`: Updated with verified checkbox mappings
- `character_model.rs`: Extended with saving throw and skill data structures  
- `pdf_filler.rs`: Enhanced with checkbox marking capabilities
- `dnd_validator.rs`: Added validation for saves/skills/spells

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow established patterns in the codebase.

## Validation

- Constitution Check: ✅ All principles maintained
- Performance: ✅ Under 1 second target aligns with requirements
- Testing: ✅ Unit tests required for all calculations
- Error Handling: ✅ Graceful degradation specified

No additional research or investigation required to proceed with implementation.
