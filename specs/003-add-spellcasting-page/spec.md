# Feature Specification: Spellcasting Page Header Population

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-spellcasting-page`  
**Created**: 2025-10-15  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to add a new feature to populate the spellcasting page header: Spellcasting class, Spellcasting Ability, Spell Save DC, and Spell Attack Bonus."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automatic Spellcasting Header Population (Priority: P1)

A D&D player fills out their character sheet and wants the spellcasting page header fields automatically populated with the correct values based on their character's class and ability scores.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that provides immediate value by eliminating manual calculations and reducing errors in spellcasting statistics.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing character data with a spellcasting class and verifying that all four header fields are correctly populated and delivers a complete spellcasting page header.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a character with Wizard class and Intelligence 16, **When** the character sheet is filled, **Then** the spellcasting header shows "Wizard", "Intelligence", spell save DC 13, and spell attack bonus +5
2. **Given** a character with Cleric class and Wisdom 14, **When** the character sheet is filled, **Then** the spellcasting header shows "Cleric", "Wisdom", spell save DC 12, and spell attack bonus +4
3. **Given** a character with Sorcerer class and Charisma 18, **When** the character sheet is filled, **Then** the spellcasting header shows "Sorcerer", "Charisma", spell save DC 14, and spell attack bonus +6

### User Story 2 - Non-Spellcaster Handling (Priority: P2)

A D&D player with a non-spellcasting character wants the spellcasting header fields to remain empty or show appropriate default values.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the feature gracefully handles characters that don't cast spells without causing errors or confusion.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing non-spellcasting character data and verifying header fields are appropriately handled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a character with Fighter class only, **When** the character sheet is filled, **Then** the spellcasting header fields remain empty
2. **Given** a character with Rogue class only, **When** the character sheet is filled, **Then** the spellcasting header fields remain empty

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a character has an invalid or unrecognized class?
- How does the system handle characters with unusual ability score values (below 1 or above 30)?
- What occurs when spellcasting ability modifier calculations result in negative values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST identify the character's primary spellcasting class from character data
- **FR-002**: System MUST determine the correct spellcasting ability for each class (Intelligence for Wizard, Wisdom for Cleric, Charisma for Sorcerer, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate spell save DC using the formula: 8 + proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate spell attack bonus using the formula: proficiency bonus + spellcasting ability modifier
- **FR-005**: System MUST populate the four spellcasting header fields: class name, ability name, save DC, and attack bonus
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle non-spellcasting classes by leaving header fields empty

### Key Entities

- **Character**: Contains class levels, ability scores, and proficiency bonus needed for spellcasting calculations
- **Spellcasting Class**: Defines which ability score is used for spellcasting (Wizard uses Intelligence, Cleric uses Wisdom, etc.)
- **Spellcasting Header**: The four fields on the character sheet that display spellcasting statistics

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: All spellcasting header fields are correctly populated for single-class spellcasters in under 1 second
- **SC-002**: Non-spellcasting characters have empty header fields without generating errors
- **SC-003**: Spell save DC and attack bonus calculations match D&D 5e rules with 100% accuracy
